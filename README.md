# Cybersecurity Attack Graph

## Project Description
The **Cybersecurity Attack Graph** visualizes relationships between different entities (e.g., servers, users, attack vectors) in a cybersecurity network using interactive graph structures. The application uses Cytoscape.js to display a dynamic graph with nodes and edges representing various entities and connections. Users can zoom, pan, and interact with the graph to explore detailed information about each node.

This tool is useful for cybersecurity professionals and researchers to analyze attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and network structures in a user-friendly and interactive manner.

## Features
- **Interactive Graph**: Displays a graph with nodes and edges representing cybersecurity elements.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Allows users to zoom in/out and pan across the graph to focus on specific areas.
- **Node Details**: Displays detailed information about a selected node, including attributes like node ID, query, response, and activity status.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and animations enhance the user experience when interacting with the graph.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Cytoscape.js**: JavaScript library for graph visualization.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
- **React Icons**: Icon library for adding UI components.
- **Animate.css**: CSS library for animations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-attack-graph.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-attack-graph
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- **Interact with the Graph**: Zoom in/out and pan around using mouse controls.
- **Select Nodes**: Click on any node to view detailed information.
- **Node Details**: Information about each node will be shown in the sidebar when clicked.
