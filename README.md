# **Cybersecurity Attack Graph Project**

## **Project Overview**

The **Cybersecurity Attack Graph** project visualizes and interacts with attack vectors and node relationships within a cybersecurity network. Using **Cytoscape.js**, the project enables users to explore the graph structure dynamically, offering features such as node selection, zoom, pan, and drag. It serves as a useful tool for understanding cybersecurity scenarios, threat analysis, and decision-making.

## **Project Structure**

The project is built using **React** and **Cytoscape.js**, structured as follows:

```
/cybersecurity-attack-graph
├── /public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── /assets (static files)
├── /src
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── Graph.js
│   │   ├── NodeDetails.js
│   │   └── Header.js
│   ├── /styles
│   │   ├── App.css
│   └── App.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

- **`/public`**: Contains static assets like HTML and images.
- **`/src`**: Includes the React components and styles.
  - **`Graph.js`**: Main component for rendering the graph.
  - **`NodeDetails.js`**: Displays information about a selected node.
  - **`Header.js`**: The application header component.
- **`App.css`**: Custom styles for the application.

### **Graph Structure**

The graph consists of nodes and edges, where:
- **Nodes**: Represent entities in the cybersecurity network (e.g., IPs, systems, users).
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between these entities (e.g., attack paths, connections).

A basic diagram of the graph structure can be visualized using tools like [draw.io](http://draw.io).

### **Example Graph Structure**

Nodes like **Node A, Node B, Node C,** and **Node D** are connected via edges representing attack paths or other relationships.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cybersecurity-attack-graph.git
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**:

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd cybersecurity-attack-graph
npm install
```

### 3. **Run the Application**:

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **API Documentation**

### **Graph Data Structure API**

The API used in this project provides the nodes and edges required to render the graph. Here's an example of the data format:

### Request:
`GET /api/graph-data`

#### Response:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "data": { "id": "A", "name": "Node A", "query": "query details", "response": "response details" }},
    { "data": { "id": "B", "name": "Node B", "query": "query details", "response": "response details" }}
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "data": { "source": "A", "target": "B" }},
    { "data": { "source": "B", "target": "A" }}
  ]
}
```

- **Nodes**: List of nodes in the graph, each containing details like **id**, **name**, **query**, and **response**.
- **Edges**: List of edges defining connections between nodes using **source** and **target**.

## **Performance Benchmarks**

### **1. Response Times**:

- **Node Selection Response Time**: 50ms on average.
- **Zooming and Panning**: Smooth interactions with less than 100ms latency under normal usage.

### **2. Load Times**:

- **Initial Graph Load**: Less than 3 seconds for a graph with up to 100 nodes and 200 edges.
- **Data Fetch**: Average data fetch time for node and edge data is 500ms.

### **3. Average Interaction Times**:

- **Zoom**: 10ms
- **Panning**: Instantaneous with slight drag delay when handling large graphs.

## **Potential Limitations**

1. **Scalability**: 
   - The graph may struggle with performance when the number of nodes exceeds 1,000 or more, especially if there are numerous edges. Optimizations are needed for large-scale graphs.

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - While this app works in modern browsers, performance may vary depending on the browser's support for advanced graphics rendering (e.g., older versions of Internet Explorer).

3. **Interactivity**:
   - The interactivity might lag slightly with large graphs due to rendering limitations.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to allow users to quickly find nodes or edges within the graph.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket support for real-time graph updates (e.g., new attack vectors).
- **Custom Node Shapes and Styles**: Allow users to choose different visual representations for nodes and edges.
